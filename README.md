# Arduino_Code and Processing Code

These files are for an automatic light switched using an arduino. The processing file is the GUI, while the Arduino code is uploaded to the microcontroller. Evidently, both are practically useless without the hardware, but just a demonstration of the code.

# Robotic_Arm_Code

This file is for a robotic arm which mimics the movement of a secondary arm. The code allows for the movement of the potentiometers of the secondary arm to be replicated in the servo motors of the main arm. Once again, this is practically useless without the hardware, but just a demonstration of the code.
